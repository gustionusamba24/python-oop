Ensure the following requirements from the game designers are completed:
1. Archer should inherit from Hero.
2. Archer should set up the hero's name and health.
3. Add a private "number of arrows" variable that can be set by the constructor.
4. Complete the shoot method. It takes a target hero as input.
    1. If there are no arrows left, raise a not enough arrows exception.
    2. Otherwise, remove an arrow and deal 10 damage to the target hero.
